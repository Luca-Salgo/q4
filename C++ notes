#Use this file for taking notes for c++ to hopefully apply later. 

#C++ code is normally stored in files. 
  there a are three types of files. 
  -ofstream: (“output file stream”): Create files and write to files.

  -ifstream: (“input file stream”): Read from files.

  -fstream: A combination of ofstream and ifstream (create, read, and write to files).


#printing stuff
std::cout is the “character output stream”. It is pronounced “see-out”.
/n is making a new line. You don't have to include it if you want to print it out on the same line. 

#Operators
-Arithmetic Operators
Arithmetic operators can be used to perform common mathematical operations:
+ addition
- subtraction
* multiplication
/ division
% modulo (yields the remainder)

-Relational Operators
Relational operators can be used to compare two values and return true or false depending on the comparison:
== equal to
!= not equal to
> greater than
< less than
>= greater than or equal to
<= less than or equal to

-Logical Operators
Logical operators can be used to combine two different conditions.
&& requires both to be true (and)
|| requires either to be true (or)
! negates the result (not)

#printing stuff
std::cout is the “character output stream”. It is pronounced “see-out”.
<< is an operator that comes right after it.
"Hello World!\n" is what’s being outputted here. You need double quotes around text. The \n is a special character that indicates a new line.
; is a punctuation that tells the computer that you are at the end of a statement. It is similar to a period in a sentence.
