Using unity game engine


4/22 - 4/26 Spend the rest of the week learning C++
4/29 - (however long it takes) start making the video game

4/29/24: working with Harrison on learning Unity's user interface. 

4/30/24: messed around with Harrison with Unity finally installed. 

5/1/24: I HATE UNITY AND EVERYTHING ABOUT IT. Me and Harrison tried to figure out how to share our project but weren't able to figure it out. 

5/2/24: We tried everything but weren't able to figure out how to share the project with each other. 

5/6/24: I was out sick. Did not do anything. 

5/7/24: Me and Harrison decided to not work together on our Unity project. I decided to change languages to C# because it is close to c++            and easier to use in unity. 

5/8/24: Learned more C#
        
5/9/24: More learning C#. After tomorrow, I will be able to put way more work onto the project. I will work on it at home. I am very excited. 

5/15/24: Learned more C# when in unity. Getting a deeper understanding of how to implement code to objects in unity. 

5/21/24: I have looking and moving down. Working on jumping.

5/24/24: finished with jumping. Working on basic shooting mechanics. After that, I'm going to work on dashing and sliding.
